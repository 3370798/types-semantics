Many exercises were left incomplete. I calculated the grade by dividing the
number of earned stars for the number of total stars. All exercises which were not
attempted have been counted as 0 stars. I added a small comments to justify the
number of deducted stars in cases of partial or incorrect solutions.

Induction: 13/32 stars

 - mult_comm: 1/4 Both proofs are incomplete, the provided comments shed some light
   on the error that was committed but the length of the provided solution should
   have been a sign that the chosen path was not the best.

 - more_exercises: 2/3 Not completed and some proofs may be a bit longer than required

Lists: 11/38 stars
	list_funs: 0/2 no tests run and only nonzeros is defined

Most of the exercises marked as optional were skipped. From my understanding of
the instructions those were not to be considered as such. Considering the
instructions were a bit unclear on this i rounded up the grade a bit.

Grade: 4
