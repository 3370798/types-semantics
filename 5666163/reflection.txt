# Reflection

Martijn Fleuren - 5666163

I marked myself by giving 1 point per exercise. Every function is worth
1/(amount of functions in the exercise) and each correct line is worth
(1/amount of correct lines in the solution). I simply added them all to get to
the final amount. Although i think i graded myself fairly, i feel like i
should have earned less points because in some cases i found a solution by
trial-and-error rather than by understanding what is really going on.

I think i made good progress, but i am still not up to the desired level due
to the steep learning curve and my background. I will try to make appointments
to work on future exercises at Joao's office so i can get some additional
support when i need it.

Deficiencies i had for this exercise are in logic and in lack of understanding
of the applicative functor. I will work on those.
