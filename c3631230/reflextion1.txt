(It's slightly messy to have the exercises interspersed with the
	chapter contents.)

	* The assertion in plus_swap worked differently than expected, manually written in comment
		therefore 3/4.
	* mult_comm_sub is splitted in different lemma's, 1 not completed. Also I did use induction...
		Therefore 2/4
	* beq_nat_refl_informal missing, therefore 0/2 on that
	* plus_swap' was affected the same way as plus_swap. No repeated deduction for that.
	* the nonzeros_app was almost finished. As this is part of a long series, rounded to 3/3
		(with a warning this sloppiness is inadequate)
	* binary_commut missing: 0/3
	* binary_inverse missing: 0/5
	* list_design missing: 0/2
	* count_member_nonzero missing: 0/3
	* bag_count_sum missing: 0/3
	* rev_injective missing: 0/4
