All exercises were completed, except for the binary inverse exercise,
which was partially completed. The hardest part, proving the conversion
theorem, was missing. There were also some easier solutions for certain
theorems and some used tactics were not necessary (in the easier
solutions). Some comments should also have been added where some of these
new tactics were used.

A part from the above, the solutions to the exercises were done well.

There were a total of 17 exercises with a combined total of 45 stars.
40 stars were definitely earned.
The binary inverse exercise was partially completed with the hardest part 
left open. 
Only 2/5 stars are therefore counted.

A total of 42 stars were earned.
