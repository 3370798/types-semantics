All the proofs were completed with the exception of binary_inverse.

Regarding that exercise a proof is provided but 3 key lemmas which are probably
almost as strong as the whole proof on their own are left as an exercise to the reader.

Since this is a self evaluation I will not count stars explicitly, I feel that the
grade that more accurately represents doing most of the work except for the really
hard parts is a 9.

Grade: 9
