Almost every exercise has been completed fully (except the binary_inverse)
Every proof is succinct with no unnecessary steps.
As I did not complete the binary exercises some longer proofs
	were harder to follow. Some contained some techniques I did not
	yet encounter in first chapters (inversion, pose, remember), it shouldn't
	be necessary probably. Comments could help understand the long statements 
	to be proven.

(As there was no model solution, and I did not finish binary_inverse myself I
could not provide answers for that)

The grading was not specified clearly.
Induction chapter:
	* 11 (required) exercises
	* 28 stars
List chapter:

Which totals at 46 stars, 41 were earned. Grade:
