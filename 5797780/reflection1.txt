# Exercise 1

1/1, perfect.

# Exercise 2

1/1, all functions correct. Transpose is more complicated than it needs to be.
See model solution.

# Exercise 3

1/1, all functions correct. Plan has a redundant case distinction.

# Exercise 4

1/1, perfect.

# Exercise 5

1/1. The distributivity proof could be a bit simpler.

# Exercise 6

1/1. SubListAntiSym takes a different approach than the model solution, but it
is correct nevertheless.

# Exercise 7 (labelled second 7 in original exercise)

1/1. Proved more implications that strictly necessary, but the proof is still
valid. Also proved equivalence with Peirce's Law.

# Exercise 8 (labelled first 7 in original exercise)

1/1, perfect.

# Exercise 9

1/1. Defining away the stack underflow problem is not the approach the model
solution takes and it is perhaps cheating a bit, but it does resolve the
issue, and it does not affect the proofs.
