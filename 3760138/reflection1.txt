Exercise 1:
Perfect
1 pt

Exercise 2:
Used vmap instead of pure in madd, but it is also correct. Model solution may be more elegant since it doesn't use recursion and doesn't split the case. 
idMatrix had the right idea, but used incorrect values (all ones). 
Transpose is correct, but very explicit and uses helper function (tail). Model solution more elegant.
0.75 pt (due to idMatrix)

Perfect

Exercise 4:
Difference should return "Succ k" instead of "k" in both nontrivial cases. 
0.5 pt (due to difference)

Exercise 5:
Distributivity proof very long and hard to read, but correct. Modes solution uses a much better notation though.
1 pt

Exercise 6:
SubListTrans does not use the same method as the model solution, but it is correct and probably more elegant since it does not use a helper function.
Contradiction found differently than model solution does, also less general.
1 pt

Exercise 7:
Uses different definition of LEQ than model solution. 
However, it is still correct, and equality to the <= is proven correctly. 
1 pt

Exercise 8:
Seems correct, but the model solution does not provide a solution to this exercise, so I cannot be sure.
1 pt 

Exercise 9:
Cmd and Stack types kept the same, while model solution changed them.
Rest of exercise seems correct, but the exec function can perform an ADD command on a stack with less than two values on it, by simply 'erroring' and returning the stack. This is probably not intended.
