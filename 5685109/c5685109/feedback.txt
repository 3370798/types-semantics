Induction exercises:
  There are 28 stars in total when excluding the last two exercises.
  (Only 19 when not counting optional exercises, as that was left unspecified in the initial e-mail)

  binary_inverse:
      Part (a) was completed, but not part (b) and (c).
      It didn't work out because the implementation of normalize is wrong.
      It will always strip off the outer Double constructor, regardless of
      the nested value. I.e. the number 2 represented by "Double (DPlusOne Z)"
      becomes just "DPlusOne Z".

      1.5 / 5 stars

  All other exercises have been solved in a reasonably concise way.

List exercises:
  There are 36 stars in total when excluding the dictionary exercises (unclear whether they still belong to Part 2).
  (Only 28 when excluding "optional" exercises).

  Every exercise has been done reasonably well.


All but 3.5 stars from the relevant parts have been achieved (including "optional" exercises).

Grade: 9.4
